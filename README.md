The program is designed for the user to be able to retrieve a list of books from their collection using a text file. It also allows them to be able to add or remove books from the file as well. 
The concepts used in this program are Input/Output of a text file.
The program uses a main menu to give the user the option of seeing their list of books, adding to their list, or removing from their list. Each selection uses a BufferedReader to read in from the text file. The add
and remove options use a PrintWriter to make the changes based on the user's input. The user is able to repeat these functions until they choose to exit the program.

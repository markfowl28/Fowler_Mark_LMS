The program is designed for the user to be able to retrieve a list of books from their collection using a text file. It also allows them to be able to add or remove books from the file, as well, check-in and check-out a book. 
The concepts used in this program are reading from a text file, writing to a text file, and creating objects.
The program uses a main menu to give the user the option of seeing the list of books in the collection, adding to the collection, removing from the collection, checking out a book from the collection, and checking in a book from the collection. Each selection uses a BufferedReader to read in from the text file. The add, remove, check-in, and check-out options also use a PrintWriter to make the changes based on the user's input. The user is able to repeat these functions until they choose to exit the program.
